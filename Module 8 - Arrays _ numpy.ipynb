Often these modules come by default with any installation of python. However, if it exists on the internet, you can likely download it and use it.\n","\n","Two common modules that are, by deafult, downloaded when you install python include `numpy` and `matplotlib`. We will focus on `numpy` here, but you will get an introduction to plotting with `matplotlib` in a later lesson.\n","\n","### So `numpy` is a module, or a collection of code. How do we use it?\n","\n","To use a module, you use the keyword `import`, which will load that module. Essentially, importing gives you access to all the code in that module, but specifying the modules you care about helps speed up load time since you don't need to access every module possible. \n","\n","It is traditional when importing `numpy` to rename it to `np` using the `as` keyword. For example, the code would be\n","```python\n","import numpy as np\n","```\n","Notice the green words are the python \"keywords\", basically saying that they have special meaning (and you can't use them as variable names).\n","\n","People rename `numpy` as `np` literally because everyone does it. In fact, you can rename any module to anything you like using the `as` keyword. That does not mean you should, however.\n","\n","Another way to use a module is to just import it and not use `as`, which would not rename the module. While you can do this for numpy, `np` is how anyone online will reference it.\n","\n","*Let's try it out.*\n","\n","Typically, people put all their imports in a cell at the top of their notebooks.
