Functions\n","\n","### Overview:\n","You've learned a lot over the previous 10 modules, and now it's time to to bring it all together!\n","\n","Your final project is to make a game, with a few specific requirements.\n","\n","### Rubric:\n","- The game must have some interactive elements (user I/O), to allow the player to actualy play the game.\n","- You must design your code before starting using Flowcharts and Pseudocode.\n","- You should use what you have learned from the past modules in some way (ex: use lists to keep tracks of player moves, or functions to perform a player's turn).\n","- You can either make your own version of one of the games from an earlier module \n","  - Battleship (Module 6: Lists)\n","  - Mad-lib (Module 3: User I/O)\n","  - Go Fish (Module 4: Conditionals & Module 6: Dictionaries)\n","  - Space Invaders (Module 9: Functions)\n","\n","  or you can make your own implementation of an existing game\n","  - Pong\n","  - Choose your own adventure (Command Line Adventure)\n","  - Snake\n","  - Checkers\n","  - Tic-Tac-Toe\n","  - Tile Puzzle (ex: 2048)\n","\n","  If you decide to make your game out of one of the ones we did in a previous module, try to add your own fun twist or additon to it. For example, Go-Fish but with \n","\n","### Quick Notes:\n","- A lot of games involve visual interfaces, which can become very complicated very fast. Try thinking of ways to implement your game without a graphical interface, and if you do want to include one, consider a text or ascii based visualization like the ones used in Battleship, Go Fish, and Space Invaders. We've got a few examples of this later that you are welcome to steal and modify for your own purposes.\n","- If you can, consider making your game at least two-player. This will make it easier to test and play it with the people around you to get feedback. However, multiple players isn't possible for every type of game, so don't worry if this isn't possible.\n","- The games listed above are not the only possibilities, you are welcome to pick another common game, or even come up with your own (ex: 3-player Tic-Tac-Toe, the world is your oyster!). Remember though, you don't have to invent the next Minecraft for it to be fun!\n","\n","### Lesson plan structure\n","1. Take the first 10-15 minutes of the lesson to come up with a rough idea of the game you would like to make. \n","    - Remember to keep it relatively simple (you have limited time)\n","    - Talk with your neighbors, share ideas\n","    - Make a short list of game elements and programming infrastructure that you think you might want to use (ex: a function for printing out a Player dictionary after their turn)\n","2. When you feel like you are ready, discuss your ideas with the instructors\n","    - Listen to feedback and refine your ideas\n","    - This is a good place to get advice on how to implement certain features\n","3. Write out your Flowcharts and Pseudocode\n","    - Demonstrate the flow of your game symbolicly, from start to finish\n","    - Start breaking the game into smaller and smaller chunks, and asking yourself what elements from previous modules are best suited for each chunk\n","    - ex: functions for repetititve tasks, dictionaries for recording player attributes, lists for a list of the player's inventory, matrices for recording the state of a game\n","4. Start Coding!\n","    - Now that you've broken up your game into chunks, go ahead and start implementing them one at a time. A good place to start is with whatever piece is going to hold the \"memory\" or \"state\" of your game.\n","    - When you get stuck on a particular bug or coding question, don't be afraid to ask the instructors for help.\n","    - Be flexible in how you implement different parts of your game. Sometimes there is an easier and faster way to get something to work, even if it wasn't the first idea that came into your mind.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"p2w3lOgQb32Q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Some Helpful Tools\n","\n","As mentioned earlier, visualization can be one of the trickier parts of any game.
