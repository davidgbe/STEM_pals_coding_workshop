If the boolean condition starts off as `False`, then the loop won't even run.\n","\n","It is important to have a stopping criterion (i.e., the boolean condition must become `False` eventually) in order to exit the loop! Otherwise the loop will run *forever.*\n","\n","Often, this means that you will update the boolean condition inside the loop. See Example 1 below.\n","\n","Note that you can have as many lines of code inside the loop, and it will run sequentially (in order) like you have seen before. \n","\n","Another way to exit the loop, other than updating the boolean condition, is by using a `break` command. A `break` inside the loop will automatically exit the loop. A common implementation (or use) of a break is by nesting it inside an `if` statement. See Example 2 below.\n","\n","Another common loop command is `pass`. Python will throw an error and yell at you if you try to run a loop without anything inside it. `pass` (along on a line, similar to how you would implement a `break` command) let's you have a placeholder that will do nothing explicitly shows that it's okay to not do anything.
